<p>What is machine learning? You probably use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Each time you do a web search on Google or Bing, that works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank <strong>what pages</strong>. When Facebook or Apple’s photo application recognizes your friends in your pictures, that’s also machine learning. Each time you read your email and a spam filter saves you from having to <strong>wade</strong> through <strong>tons of</strong>  spam, <strong>again</strong>, that’s because your computer has learned to <strong>distinguish</strong> spam from non-spam email. So, that’s machine learning. There’s a science of getting computers to learn without being <strong>explicitly programmed</strong>. One of the research projects that I’m working on is getting robots to <strong>tidy up</strong> the house. <strong>How do you go about doing that?</strong> Well what you can do is <strong>have</strong> the robot watch you <strong>demonstrate</strong> the task and learn from that. The robot can then watch what objects you pick up and <strong>where to put them</strong> and try to do the same thing even when you aren’t there. For me, one of the reasons I’m excited about this is the AI, or artificial intelligence problem. Building truly intelligent machines, we can do just about anything that you or I can do. Many scientists think the best way to <strong>make progress</strong> on this is through learning algorithms called <strong>neural networks</strong>, which <strong>mimic</strong> how the human brain works, and I’ll teach you about that, too. In this class, you learn about machine learning and get to implement them yourself. I hope you sign up on our website and join us.</p>

<p>Welcome to this free online class on machine learning. Machine learning is one of the most exciting recent technologies. And in this class, you learn about the state of the art and also gain practice implementing and deploying these algorithms yourself. You’ve probably use a learning algorithm dozens of times a day without knowing it. Every time you use a web search engine like Google or Bing to search the internet, one of the reasons that works so well is because a learning algorithm, one implemented by Google or Microsoft, has learned how to rank web pages. Every time you use Facebook or Apple’s photo typing application and it recognizes your friends’ photos, that’s also machine learning. Every time you read your email and your spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam email, that’s also a learning algorithm. For me one of the reasons I’m excited is the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as you or me. We’re a long way away from that goal, but many AI researchers believe that the best way to towards that goal is through learning algorithms that try to mimic how the human brain learns. I’ll tell you a little bit about that too in this class. In this class you learn about state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. But it turns out just knowing the algorithms and knowing the math isn’t that much good if you don’t also know how to actually get this stuff to work on problems that you care about. So, we’ve also spent a lot of time developing exercises for you to implement each of these algorithms and see how they work fot yourself. So why is machine learning so prevalent today? It turns out that machine learning is a field that had grown out of the field of AI, or artificial intelligence. We wanted to build intelligent machines and it turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. But for the most part we just did not know how to write AI programs to do the more interesting things such as web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam. There was a realization that the only way to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. So, machine learning was developed as a new capability for computers and today it touches many segments of industry and basic science. For me, I work on machine learning and in a typical week I might end up talking to helicopter pilots, biologists, a bunch of computer systems people (so my colleagues here at Stanford) and averaging two or three times a week I get email from people in industry from Silicon Valley contacting me who have an interest in applying learning algorithms to their own problems. This is a sign of the range of problems that machine learning touches. There is autonomous robotics, computational biology, tons of things in Silicon Valley that machine learning is having an impact on. Here are some other examples of machine learning. There’s database mining. One of the reasons machine learning has so pervaded is the growth of the web and the growth of automation All this means that we have much larger data sets than ever before. So, for example tons of Silicon Valley companies are today collecting web click data, also called clickstream data, and are trying to use machine learning algorithms to mine this data to understand the users better and to serve the users better, that’s a huge segment of Silicon Valley right now. Medical records. With the advent of automation, we now have electronic medical records, so if we can turn medical records into medical knowledge, then we can start to understand disease better. Computational biology. With automation again, biologists are collecting lots of data about gene sequences, DNA sequences, and so on, and machines running algorithms are giving us a much better understanding of the human genome, and what it means to be human. And in engineering as well, in all fields of engineering, we have larger and larger, and larger and larger data sets, that we’re trying to understand using learning algorithms. A second range of machinery applications is ones that we cannot program by hand. So for example, I’ve worked on autonomous helicopters for many years. We just did not know how to write a computer program to make this helicopter fly by itself. The only thing that worked was having a computer learn by itself how to fly this helicopter.

<h2 id="Supervised-Learning"><a href="#Supervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Supervised Learning"></a>Supervised Learning</h2><p>In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.</p>
<p>Supervised learning problems are categorized into “regression” and “classification” problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a <strong>discrete</strong> output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Given data about the size of houses on the <strong>real estate</strong> market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.</p>
<p>We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house “sells for more or less than the asking price.” Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>:</p>
<p>(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture</p>
<p>(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is <strong>malignant</strong> or <strong>benign</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="Unsupervised-Learning"><a href="#Unsupervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Unsupervised Learning"></a>Unsupervised Learning</h2><p>Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables.</p>
<p>We can <strong>derive</strong> this structure by <strong>clustering</strong> the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.</p>
<p>With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are <strong>somehow</strong> similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.</p>
<p>Non-clustering: The “Cocktail Party Algorithm”, allows you to find structure in a <strong>chaotic</strong> environment. (i.e. <strong>identifying</strong> individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect">cocktail party</a>).</p>

<h1 id="Model-Representation"><a href="#Model-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation"></a>Model Representation</h1><p>To establish notation for future use, we’ll use x(i)<em>x</em>(<em>i</em>) to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and y(i)<em>y</em>(<em>i</em>) to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair (x(i),y(i))(<em>x</em>(<em>i</em>),<em>y</em>(<em>i</em>)) is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples (x(i),y(i));i=1,…,m(<em>x</em>(<em>i</em>),<em>y</em>(<em>i</em>));<em>i</em>=1,…,<em>m</em>—is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ. </p>
<p>To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/H6qTdZmYEeaagxL7xdFKxA_2f0f671110e8f7446bb2b5b2f75a8874_Screenshot-2016-10-23-20.14.58.png?expiry=1630972800000&amp;hmac=54b6aVobWCTXKEMoE7HUwC3NR-1u_-kM5lUC2Hu85S0" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="img"></p>
<p> When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.</p>
